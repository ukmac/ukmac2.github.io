      <description>More Obsidian testing Test Test 2 Another head Today I came across this article on MacStories in which Federico Vittici describes how he uses Working Copy and GitHub to manage his writing with iA Writer and Pretext.
While I have been testing Working Copy I have tried creating a synced folder with the local Obsidian app folders and also with the Obsidians folder in iCloud. Both seemed to work fine but I was a bit unsure whether syncing with iCloud was recommended and hadnâ€™t found any articles to confirm this was something you should do (in the past this sort of approach would have been a recipe for duplicated files and other odd issues).</description>
