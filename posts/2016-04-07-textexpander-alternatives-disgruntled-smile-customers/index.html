<a href="https://smilesoftware.com/">Smile Software</a> decision to move to a subscription model for version 6 of
<a href="https://textexpander.com/">TextExpander</a>more, their popular text snippet app for OS X and iOS. Most of the words have understandably been pretty negative with users feeling that the change is purely a money grab by Smile. Obviously the economics of making a niche product like

<p>There are a few alternatives to

<a href="http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/">Typinator</a> from

<a href="https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W">offering a discount</a> to existing TextExpander users to move to their product during April.</p>
<p>The app is normally EUR 24.99 for a single user or EUR 37.99 for a family pack so the reduction makes it EUR 18.75 and EUR 28.50 respectively. To access the offer
<a href="https://store.ergonis.com/products/typinator/?cp=TE1604W">go to this link</a> before the end of the month.</p>
<p>If you are not happy spending this much on an alternative then a cheaper option is
<a href="http://www.trankynam.com/atext/">aText</a> at just $4.99.###UPDATE:</p>
<p>So it seems that the reasoning that Smile have given for the decision is based on the sharing features added in the updated version of TextExpander. They state
<a href="https://smilesoftware.com/blog/entry/textexpander-release-follow-up">on this page</a> that the iCloud/Dropbox services would not allow them to implement the Group Sharing features that are the key new element of TextExpander.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Group sharing in the new TextExpander is quite different than syncing via Dropbox or iCloud. Sharing, as it stands, couldn’t work using either sync service.</p>
