      <description>More Obsidian testing Test Test 2 Another head Today I came across this article on MacStories in which Federico Vittici describes how he uses Working Copy and GitHub to manage his writing with iA Writer and Pretext.
While I have been testing Working Copy I have tried creating a synced folder with the local Obsidian app folders and also with the Obsidians folder in iCloud. Both seemed to work fine but I was a bit unsure whether syncing with iCloud was recommended and hadnâ€™t found any articles to confirm this was something you should do (in the past this sort of approach would have been a recipe for duplicated files and other odd issues).</description>

      <description>Over the last couple of days there has been a lot written about the Smile Software decision to move to a subscription model for version 6 of TextExpandermore, their popular text snippet app for OS X and iOS. Most of the words have understandably been pretty negative with users feeling that the change is purely a money grab by Smile. Obviously the economics of making a niche product like TextExpander pay its way are not simple and I really don&amp;rsquo;t know if the change was actually an unavoidable option, but regardless of the reasons behind the decision it is fairly clear that a fair number of Smiles previous customers will be thinking twice about the upgrade and looking at alternative options.</description>
